# What is StartVest?
StartVest is an equity crowdfunding platform that allows people with creative ideas to register and get access to investors. We provide everyone the option to see disruptive ideas and startups at the early stage, and we also give startups the platform to post job vacancies for job seekers.

Despite the fact that startup investment in Africa has expanded dramatically in recent years, African startups are still less well-funded than startups anywhere else in the globe especially at the pre-seed stage. Our main goal at StartVest is to use crowdsourcing to close the gap in underfunding of early stage entrepreneurs in Africa.

We want to provide everyone an opportunity to fulfill their dreams by making it simple for people to seek investment for their innovative ideas, find jobs, and invest in disruptive companies.

## Mission Statement
To be the platform that facilitates the creation of a secure network between entrepreneurs and investors, to foster an atmosphere in which ideas can be readily transformed into profitable businesses.

## Our Vision
To be the initial point of contact for anyone interested in investing in Africa's startup ecosystem.
